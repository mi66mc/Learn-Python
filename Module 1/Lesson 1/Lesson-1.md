# Lesson 1

## Installing Python

- Click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install Python

## Installing Visual Studio Code

- I recommend the code editor called "Visual Studio Code", you can install [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## After setting up Visual Studio Code

- Create a directory (folder)
- Create a python file in the directory named as you want, and it needs to has `.py` after file name

## Python file

> In the Python file you can write the code (obviously)

> An example of the code:

```py
print('Hello, World!')
```

> The output will look this:

```
Hello, World!
```

### The basic

- You can declare a variable with "="

```py
number = 1
string = 'Hello!'
```

- And you can show this in the ouput with the print function

```py
number = 1
string = 'Hello!'

print(number)
print(string)
```
